               MY APPROACH
--------------------------------------------

* My approach was to make an easily maintenable Drupal website with a pixel perfect design.
I structured the content types with names relating to the type of content on display on the home page, and for those items on the home    page which does not relate to any content, i created a Home page elements content type, to allow users to be able to alter the content of particular blocks. All the links on the website are editable. 

* I utilised the Views module with content related titles to allow users to easily alter the outlook of content if necessary.

* The websites overall responsiveness was achieved with a combination of using percentages for widths, rems for top and bottom margins and media queries to alter content at specific break points.
